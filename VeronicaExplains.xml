      <title>45Drives hasn&#39;t sent me any hardware and I still think they&#39;re neat</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=MSV5nImeYJg</link>
      <description>Let&#39;s talk about 45Drives, why I like their open source Cockpit modules, as well as their tutorials and documentation about open source projects.&#xA;&#xA;I think it&#39;s rare to have a corporation care this much about open source. From my outsider view as someone who has never been sent anything from 45Drives, I think it&#39;s refreshing. And I want to talk about it!&#xA;&#xA;This video was not sponsored, 45Drives has not only (to date) not sent me any hardware, but we&#39;ve had no business dealings at all: no money changing hands, no free trips to see their factory, nothing like that. Again, this is as of filming: can&#39;t predict the future! :)&#xA;&#xA;Patrons and Ko-Fi members make Veronica Explains possible:&#xA;- https://patreon.com/VeronicaExplains&#xA;- https://ko-fi.com/VeronicaExplains&#xA;&#xA;Links referenced in the video:&#xA;- The 45Drives website: https://www.45drives.com/&#xA;- And @45Drives is on YouTube (it&#39;s a great channel).&#xA;- Their file sharing Cockpit module: https://github.com/45Drives/cockpit-file-sharing&#xA;- FTC disclosures for social media influencers: https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/disclosures-101-social-media-influencers&#xA;- The older of the two ZFS modules from 45Drives: https://github.com/45Drives/cockpit-zfs-manager&#xA;- And the newer one they&#39;re building from scratch: https://github.com/45Drives/cockpit-zfs&#xA;- Friend of the channel Tom gave me permission to share his clips here, go check out his channel if you&#39;re not already subscribed: @LAWRENCESYSTEMS &#xA;- My blog post where I go into a bit more detail about how to install these modules: https://vkc.sh/45drives-cockpit/&#xA;&#xA;Chapters:&#xA;0:00 45Drives hasn&#39;t sponsored me in any way... so far&#xA;3:00 What is Cockpit anyway?&#xA;4:54 Looking at two 45Drives modules for Cockpit&#xA;6:17 But...
