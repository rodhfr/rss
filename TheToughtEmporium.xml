    <title>The Thought Emporium</title>

    <description>Science is a bottomless well of some of the most amazing things this universe has to offer. There is so much amazing science and engineering that gets done, but most often the only ones who get to experience it first hand are those in expensive labs in universities. This channel aims to explore as much of fields of science and engineering as possible by showing real experiments and research being done in a fun and accessible way. While the goal is to show that even very hard science can be done in a DIY way, some projects will use some of the fancier toys that while less accessible, opens a broader range of projects that can be done. We cover everything from genetic engineering and tissue culture, to nuclear physics, to machine engineering, to chemical synthesis and more.</description>

      <title>This bacteria can withstand a nuclear reactor! ☢️</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=oXDMZMPCIxM</link>
      <description>Deinococcus radiodurans was the first of the ultra high radiation resistant microbes to have been discovered. Found back in the 1950&#39;s it survived an experiment where cans of food were exposed to what should have been a sterilizing dose of radiation. Yet one of the cans still spoiled which led to it&#39;s discovery. The whole deinococcus family is filled with ultra hearty microbes. Some are found to be even more resistant than radiodurans.</description>

      <title>Growing Penicillin from a SLAB of Mold</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=aWah0ipEllM</link>
      <description>Penicillin, the wonder drug that changed the world, is one of many drugs that are grown rather than synthesized from petroleum products. Penicillin gets it&#39;s name from the mold it&#39;s grown from, penicillium chrysogenum.</description>
