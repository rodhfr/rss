    <description>Welcome to Usagi Electric!&#xA;&#xA;On this channel, we dive into old school technology, focusing heavily on vacuum tubes. My primary goal is to build computing circuits based off the legendary machines of yesteryear, only with a slight modern twist. All the tubes will be operating with very low voltages on the plate, making the projects safe and easy to follow along with. So, lets grab our multimeters, some random tubes and a low voltage power supply and have fun!&#xA;&#xA;Usagi Electric covers one of my main passions, while my other main passion can be found over on Usagi Motors.</description>

      <title>I Failed to Get Any of These Working on My PDP-11</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=f7mwExR7ACw</link>
      <description>The PDP-11 supercomputer was originally intended to be used with the Fujitsu Eagle, but ultimately, that’s not going to work out because the Eagle is a bit too new, both for me and for the PDP-11. The Eagle is a modified SMD drive, which makes it too fast for the UNIBUS and requires a highly specialized controller card, which I don’t have. So, today, we try to get some other, smaller hard drives working on the 11/44, and we fail spectacularly. It’s all about the journey and not the destination, right?
